Howdy stranger, I've worked in PHP since it was still cool. I've also:

* Organized large communities (2003-present)
* Helped build [Vanilla Forums](https://github.com/vanilla/vanilla/blob/884eea88f8ff0b13d65689caf08c33d2fd0b91e5/composer.json#L20) (2009-2019)
* Forked [Porter](https://github.com/linc/nitro-porter) & rebuilt it as a "universal" community migration tool (2021-present)
* Lead engineering at [uConnect](https://www.gouconnect.com) (2022-present)
* Co-lead [Agorakit](https://github.com/agorakit), a hypermedia community platform (2024-present)

I'm delighted to infodump about communities, leadership, or hypermedia at the slightest invitation.
